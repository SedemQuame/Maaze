Description
The maaze game seeks to be a cross over between a puzzle type game and an action game.
The player's goal is to get the reward which is spawned at the beginning of the level.
He is supposed to do this by dodging all enemy game objects present in the game.

This is version 0 of the project, as such it some bugs are to be expexted.
Please write down any unexpected things you seen throughout the game and send them to the email.
